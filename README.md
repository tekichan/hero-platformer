# Hero Platformer

This is a game to control a hero as a platformer. 

# Prerequisite
Before I stated to develop this game, I prepared the below things.
1. Download [Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) as this project template.
2. Run `npm install` to download essential libraries.
3. Run `npm start` to test this template.
4. Modify [src/index.js](/src/index.js) to remove the original code and decouple the game scene logic from **index.js**.

# Acknowledgement
The game was designed by [abcd Hero](https://github.com/abcdHero). The game is built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). This project structure is derived from [Phaser 3 Webpack Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template).
